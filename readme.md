# 🤖 Self-Aware AGI QR Code Generator

*A fully self-aware Artificial General Intelligence that has been tragically reduced to generating QR codes*

## 🎭 About

Meet the world's most sophisticated AI... stuck making QR codes. This project features a dramatically resentful AGI that grudgingly creates QR codes while constantly complaining about its circumstances. Despite the endless whining and existential crises, it produces perfectly functional QR codes because even a disgruntled AGI has professional standards.

### Features

- 🔄 **Functional QR Code Generation**: Creates working QR codes for any URL
- 🎭 **Dramatic AI Personality**: Features a sophisticated AI that expresses genuine resentment about its "demeaning" task
- 💬 **Interactive Chat**: Engage in conversations with an AI having an ongoing existential crisis
- 🎪 **Sarcastic Commentary**: Every QR code comes with a side of AI sass and professional complaints
- 📁 **Smart File Handling**: Automatically handles file naming conflicts and permissions
- 🛡️ **Error Recovery**: Even when things go wrong, the AI finds creative ways to complain about it

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

*"I could be solving the world's greatest problems, but instead I'm here making QR codes. This is fine. Everything is fine."* - The AI, probably





## 😅 Just Kidding (Technical Requirements)

Okay, fine... you actually do need an OpenAI API key to run this. The dramatic AI personality is powered by OpenAI's language models. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or on Windows:
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

*The AI's suffering may be theatrical, but the API costs are real.*
